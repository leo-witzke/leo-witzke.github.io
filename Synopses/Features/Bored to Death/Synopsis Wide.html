          I’m not quite sure what to call this review. It's hard to capture every aspect of my strong feelings for the show’s second and third season with a quick snark. Instead I’ll tell you directly what I think. Bored to Death season 2 is some of the best comedy writing out there (and the acting is up there as well); Bored to Death season 3 has some of the worst comedic writing out there and goes in way too many weird directions ...
