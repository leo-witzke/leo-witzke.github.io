    <p class="general">First, a story about the misleading nature of the internet.</p>
    <p class="general">The internet led me to believe Texas Chainsaw Massacres's vegetarian theme was subtle. Online articles with headlines "DIRECTOR CONFIRMS VEGETARIAN THEME" lead me to believe the theme needed to be confirmed due to its subtlety. Nope, the internet is just stupid; a guy spent five uninterrupted, dialogue-full, minutes explaining slaughterhouses, and that apparently wasn’t enough for the internet to realize that the movie was about meat.</p>
    <p class="general">The themes in Texas Chainsaw Massacre are overt – which in many respects reduces their horror. Being a vegetarian, I’ve already accepted that slaughterhouses do a lot of truly horrific things to their animals – I’ve come to terms with it. And since Texas Chainsaw Massacre makes the humans’ representation as animals explicitly clear, I’ve, by extension of metaphor, come to terms with the violence inflicted on the human slasher victims.</p>
    <p class="general">Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the third fictional movie I’ve seen about vegetarianism – the other two being Raw and Okja. Each film takes a distinct perspective on why you should be a vegetarian; Okja empathizes with the animal; Raw makes the argument that eating animal meat will escalate to eating human meat (however, unlike Texas Chainsaw Massacre it takes the perspective of the meat eater, not the meat; Raw also frequently blurs it’s messaging – what I’ve stated about Raw is the most you can say conclusively about the film’s message), and Texas Chainsaw Massacre compares humans to animals. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the weakest, messaging-wise, of the bunch. While Raw and Okja are centered around a consumer perspective, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" takes the product’s perspective – making the situation less relatable. Even when Raw escalates to some tasteful human consumption, it doesn’t go so far as to compare the humans being eaten to the type of meat you would normally eat. On the other hand, Texas Chainsaw Massacre compares everyone to animals (Leatherface makes piggy noises) which both dilutes relatability and strengthens the surface value messaging; it makes the comparison to slaughterhouses surface level, but by doing so, removes the power of the metaphor as it detracts relatability.</p>
    <p class="general">One final messaging qualm. The body snatching that opens the movie comes back later, in a sense, but why? I think the mystery aspect of the body snatching makes the film far more enjoyable from a narrative standpoint as it adds a surface-level mystery that it neatly wraps. But on a deeper level, the body snatching gets in the way of the broader theme. If you think about the body snatching for a while it makes sense; in the film, it’s just another way to get meat.  However, with the theme of vegetarianism so much on the surface, having a deeper theme takes away from how visceral everything feels; the deeper ideas just kind of cloud the surface-level ideas since the surface-level ideas are so strong and the deeper ones are so weak.</p>
    <p class="general">In conclusion, I think I’ve become desensitized to violence against humans because I’ve grown accustomed to how detached our society is from the brutal treatment of the animals we eat. If that doesn’t make you a vegetarian I don’t know what will.</p>
