    <p class="general">I’m no Scooby-Doo expert. While doing research for this article, I learned more about Scooby-Doo’s lore than I thought existed. Scooby-Doo has a simple premise, but one that becomes complex when enough iterations circulate. Later on, I’ll pitch a Scooby-Doo movie; ignore me if the story’s already been told and I just haven’t heard it. I haven’t seen every Scooby-Doo, and even if I had, subliminal impressions of Scooby’s best moments can turn into a story without me noticing. I may repeat a story already told, which is ironically why I wanted to write this article – Scooby-Doo stories get repetitive. Let that preface this article.</p><p class="general">From a narrative standpoint, I don’t believe Scooby-Doo needs to go anywhere; the formula they’ve perfected is endlessly entertaining. However, it is when franchises are at their most stable that new developments should be pursued. So, although they don’t need to improve, how can Scooby-Doo improve: where can Scooby-Doo go?</p><p class="general">A lot can be learned from how Mystery Incorporated interpreted Scooby-Doo. Mystery Incorporated did real character work (in the form of romances) that supported an ending with a real message: all that was holding the gang together was the mysteries, without the mysteries they aren’t friends. It’s a little dark, but it’s taking advantage of Scooby-Doo as a platform to explore something deeper. This is where Scooby-Doo should continue to go.</p><p class="general">Another example of using an episodic platform to delve into serious issues is Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. This movie came from the Batman: The Animated Series era and used the trauma of Bruce Wayne’s parent's death to show how trauma and responses to trauma can ruin love and relationships. It does this by exploring Batman’s background and giving Batman a foil with a similar background.</p><p class="general">Scooby-Doo doesn’t have a background to explore or a good foil to put them up against – at least they didn’t until Mystery Incorporated gave them one. Professor Pericles and his gang acted as the foil and the background was all the previous mystery-solving groups from crystal cove that had been created and fallen apart in the past. It's much easier to examine deeper themes within properties such as Scooby-Doo and Batman when there is a foil and background to explore (that's just basic storytelling). However, while Batman grew on the backs of a backstory (parents killed in crime alley) and a primary foil (Joker), Scooby-Doo was always centered around the mystery. So, how can you use the mystery and years of past Scooby-Doo’s to accomplish the same end; i.e. let's limit ourselves from giving Scoob and the gang a backstory and foil to stay within the narrative tradition.</p><p class="general">The tricks I’m going to use are character development (that counts as a trick in the Doo-verse), two monsters, love subplots, a consistent message tied to the franchise, and having Scooby-Doo be captured because of the other’s character flaws (and a massive final set piece because every good Scooby-Doo has one; I’m genuinely surprised when Scooby-Doo writers don’t throw in a crazy final set piece). There are more tricks incorporated along the way, but let's jump into the pitch.</p><p class="general">Velma has been receiving letters from a hotel owner in Australia saying a ghost or specter of sorts has been terrorizing the hotel and driving away business. Coincidentally, Freddy was planning to go to Australia for pilot school because his cousin owns the school. So, the gang packs up for Australia (yes, I know they’ve already visited Australia for a feature-length movie, but I'm going to tread over dissimilar ground so I should be good). We get some remark on how Freddy has tried to be so many things and has so many family members with odd business.</p><p class="general">When the gang lands in Australia, we meet some of the suspects. As they’re getting off the plane, they’re confronted by some media attention and we meet a reporter looking for the big scoop. When they get to the hotel, they meet the guy who has been sending Velma all those letters; he’s on the weird side and is blown away that the gang is responding to his letters. He takes them up to their hotel room – which is pretty messy and run-down, but of course, he calls it the best room in the hotel.</p><p class="general">Fred immediately goes off to pilot school where he meets Jill and romantic tensions are introduced. It starts over a mutual love of traps and then Freddy saves her from a plane crash or some other external conflict involving flight using a trap. Specifically, he saves her using the Freddy Knot – a knot Feedy developed for use in trapping.</p><p class="general">The gang decides to go out for dinner, but Freddy ditches the rest to go hang with Jill. Daphne is upset that Fred ditched them for someone else; not in a romantic way, but in a friendly way. Velma tells her to get over it and we get some good Scooby and Shaggy banter as food arrives first for Velma and Daphne. Shaggy tries to distract Velma and Daphne by saying look over there and then Scooby uses his tail to steal food from them, but Velma and Daphne can’t stop looking away … because the specter’s behind them (let me interject quickly by saying writing Scooby-Doos is so much fun; they have such a fun and unique tone that allows you get to do stuff like this). A blue specter comes down on them and attacks the restaurant, leaving it in shambles.</p><p class="general">Later, Shaggy and Scooby try to explain what happened to Fred but embellish a ton of details. Both try to write themselves in as heroes as they explain what happened, but Fred isn’t listening – he’s thinking about Jill. A small detail that we’ll slip in at this point is a newspaper with a picture of the specter on the front that Scooby will pick up to imitate the ghost. The headline reads: “BLUE SPECTRE DESTROYS RESTAURANT; IS THIS THE FIRST OF MANY ATTACKS?” and, of course, the article is written by the reporter.</p><p class="general">Velma goes out to look for clues and Daphne joins her. Velma says that with Freddy gone with a girl, she is going to have to rise up in the group. She tries to prove herself as a detective to Velma but fails. While examining the scene of the crime, Velma spots the reporter and hotel owner meeting up and exchanging something, but before they can confront the reporter and hotel owner, we meet another suspect: a very buff bank/insurance agent (he works for a company that handles both insurance and banking) who is trying to foreclose on the property because the insurance company doesn’t cover specter related accidents. The restaurant owner/chef is very angry. Velma tries to confront him but he is very dismissive. Daphne throws a rock at him, but he doesn’t even flinch. Daphne says maybe detective work isn’t for her.</p><p class="general">Cut to Scooby, Shaggy, Freddy, and Jill on a bus tour of Australia; our final suspect is the tour guide who mentions a variety of treasures and where they all can be found (we whip-pan through Australian landmarks – that aren’t near each other at all – as the tour guide explains what treasure lies beneath them). She concludes by saying that the best treasure is … she is interrupted by Velma and Daphne who are boarding the bus (somehow Velma knows the tour guide from some adventure far in the past). Velma takes over and explains that the best treasure is an amulet that – while its composition is unknown – is said to have sparked many wars, but it’s now lost in the caves beneath Australia. Velma and Daphne join the rest of the crew on the bus. Daphne threatens Fred that she’s going to become the trap maker of the group: Fred semi-ignores her. The tour guide speaks up and says the entrance to the cave that holds the artifact is unknown: it could be anywhere (even below your house or business establishment that has been recently demolished by a specter). At this point, the bus passes by the rubbled restaurant and all the tourists get up to take a photo. The tour guide says that's not part of the tour and suggests they move on quickly.</p><p class="general">We get one quick scene of them exploring the sites and then another of them catching lunch. Jill brings up that she needs money because flight school has put her in debt and she wishes she could find that amulet, but Freddy doesn’t completely hear her because Shaggy and Scoob are passing two increasingly large sandwiches between Fred and Jill. Each time they ask for something more on their sandwich and the other adds it to the sandwich and passes it back.</p><p class="general">Alright, now that the first act has been swept through, I’m just going to briefly cover the second act. When the specter appears for the second time, Daphne tries to be the trap maker but makes a faulty trap; Fred gets in competition with her, but is overconfident and makes a faulty trap that Scooby accidentally gets trapped in. The blue specter gets away and the faulty trap sends Scooby flying off a cliff. A second red specter catches Scooby from falling and takes him away. Scooby later awakes alone in a cave. Shaggy is afraid he can’t protect his dog anymore and becomes angry with the rest of the group (later, with Scooby gone, Shaggy can try to eat all the food they packed for Scooby and comes up very unsuccessfully). There’s a lot more development to be done in the second act (of both the characters and the suspects). Both the red and blue specter should appear multiple more times and we should probably have one good chase with the blue specter. The red specter should leave behind some rope with a Freddy Knot on it. Jill should always be asking Freddy for details on their case. The reporter should be seen at one point talking to the tour guide and there’s more to be done with Shaggy's character arc (he will also try to solve mysteries like Velma because he is now dedicated to finding Scooby), but I’ve already gone on long enough so I’ll leave that to the imagination.</p><p class="general">When we get to the third act, the gang splits up to search for Scoob in the caves the treasure is buried in (the entrance to the cave being under the rubble of one of the buildings the blue specter destroyed). Fred goes on his own and the red specter follows him. He finds the treasure and turns around to yell “guys I found it”, but no one is there to hear him. Except for the specter who chases him to the edge of a cliff within the cave. The red specter takes off her mask to reveal herself as Jill. She asks Fred to give her the artifact; Fred, backed up against a cliff, gives her the amulet. Fred said he knew she was one of the specters but he just didn’t want to believe it. She replies that she didn’t want to believe it either and then runs off (this is a climactic moment that I haven’t written much of the build up for so just imagine a lot of build up).</p><p class="general">But Jill/red specter doesn’t get too far because the rest of the gang was secretly following Fred and the red specter. When Jill tries to leave, the others come out and trap her. Fred snatches the amulet back and reunites with the gang – telling them he won't ditch them for a love interest again and that he knows they’ll never take advantage of him like Jill did. Capturing the red specter this way was Fred’s plan all along.</p><p class="general">Out from the shadows comes the blue specter. We get a chase through the caves and at some point, Scooby deus ex machinas his way into saving Shaggy from danger and Scooby says he’ll always be there to protect Shaggy. We then move into a plane chase with Freddy and Jill chasing after the specter (Jill makes a small turn to help Freddy). Scoby, Shaggy, and Velma start throwing things out of the plane at the blue specter, but one of them accidentally throws some important part of the plane at the blue specter and the plane goes down. At the last minute, Daphne throws a rope at the blue specter that catches onto its leg. The plane makes a crash landing on the water and skids up to the shore.</p><p class="general">Daphne pulls in the blue specter and Freddy notices that she had tied a Freddy Knot on the end (this was the part that got caught around the specter’s leg). Unmask the blue specter to be the tour guide who said she was tired of taking advantage of tourists and instead decided to take advantage of the people she knew; going around town all day, she had met so many people saying their businesses have caves underneath them and she had to explore them for herself before anyone else could get to them. When the gang arrived, she knew she had to act quick or the gang might get to it first (ideally this motive would be emphasized significantly in the second act).</p><p class="general">Shaggy asks how she knew they were coming to Australia and Velma provides the answer. The hotel owner had been sending them letters before any real specter had appeared; he wanted the gang to stay at his hotel to boost his failing business. If the gang stayed at his hotel, others would follow (again, this would be emphasized in the second act with a ton of people suddenly staying at the hotel who are obsessed with the gang). Here, Velma gets to give the hotel owner a nice insult about how his hotel was losing business because it’s run down and not because they weren’t staying there. Naturally, the hotel owner told everyone he knew that the gang was coming down – including the report which is why he knew the gang’s every move. The reporter then told the tour guide of the hotel owner's plan and the tour guide knew she had to take up the specter's costume before the gang found the amulet. The hotel owner was just trying to take advantage of us, says Velma. Shaggy declares they’re not paying, says “come on gang”, and they all walk off.</p><p class="general">The gang then confronts Jill who says she took up the red specter costume to scare others away from the cave as she explored. She also explains that she put Scooby in the cave because she thought he would be able to use his mystery-solving abilities to sniff out the treasure. Velma tells her they only can solve mysteries when they’re together and we move on (this moment would also ideally be reinforced in the second act).</p><p class="general">This story isn’t much, but I think it's a step above for Scooby-Doo while still filling in the charms of the gang. Velma could use more character work, but this article is already far too long. And obviously, this pitch doesn’t answer every question. How can the specters fly? Probably something related to flight school but who knows: that's a question for a later date. There’s a lot more ground to explore in this pitch; at some point in the second act the red and blue specter should meet, there's a lot more character work to be done, etc. And even more obvious, there is a lot more mystery to be developed and motives to be alluded to in the second act.</p><p class="general">However, my goal was simply to show that a Scooby-Doo can be more than it currently is without any added background or foil (which would seriously make the writing so much easier), and I think I’ve done that. A gift can be taken advantage of if you aren’t careful; why shouldn’t Scooby-Doo deal with that message? That’s a mystery worth solving.</p>
