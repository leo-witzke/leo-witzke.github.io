    <p class="general">What are the form distinctions between books and movies? Simply put, books have words; movies are audio-visual. However, they’re both complex storytelling platforms, so drawing the line there seems a bit arbitrary. Why not go a little into what they can accomplish? In the end, they aren’t all too different. Most differences come from the culture surrounding the form rather than the form itself; however, these aren’t the differences I want to focus on.</p>
    <p class="general">There are, of course, a lot of cherry-pickable differences and similarities that could be discussed; books don’t have scores, descriptions in books are comparable to the cinematography of movies, etc. However, unless this is the first time you happen to be reflecting on the forms’ distinctions, these aren’t interesting or insightful points to bring up. So let's move on to focusing on details and pacing.</p>
    <p class="general">Details are typically thought of as the book’s domain. Books can be longer than movies, so naturally, they are allowed to describe and say more – i.e. have more details. However, I would argue that details succeed less in books. Details in books have to be explicitly stated; in film, a table can be red without attention being called to it, in a book, the table must be stated to be red. Books are thought to have more detail because details have to be stated in books. Film exceeds when details are left to the audience to find and decipher. If anything, films have more details than books – as long as you're looking for them. I see this as a major advantage to films; they can let details be subtle and subconsciously build themes around them. I’ve seen directors hide words, details, and phrases from the audience by cutting away from the speaker's face; the secret to the murderer’s identity was given away, but you didn’t realize that because that's not who the camera was focused on when it was given away. There’s no equivalent to this in books (at least not one that I know of which is commonly used enough to warrant mention here).</p>
    <p class="general">Pace is put under more scrutiny in movies than in books; slow movies will get slammed for dragging on, but slow books – even when their length is intimidating – don’t receive the same treatment. Parts of these criticisms come from a culture that has adjusted to fast-paced movies, but some of it comes from elsewhere. Time in movies can’t be stretched the way time in a book can. You have to watch movies at the speed they occur (i.e. you can’t put slow-mo over a scene without calling attention to yourself); the speed of life is the speed of the movie (at least when considering individual scenes; movies themselves can span much shorter or much longer than their runtime). This isn’t the case in books where time is determined by how long the author spends writing about it. An author can make a kiss last five pages to stretch out how long the reader feels it; they can also wrap up a days-long battle in a sentence by declaring who won and force the reader to move on. There are some parallels to film here (to declare who won the war, a shot of the winning flag on the battlefield may suffice); however, these parallels are scarce. The only one I would like to bring up is cross-cutting. George Lucas and Christopher Nolan can make climaxes last 30 minutes by cross-cutting, but for the average movie, that's not a trick at their disposal. Additionally, time in books must be taken up by words, whereas, time in films can be taken up by silence.</p>
    <p class="general">All these differences in pacing make film much more compatible for a couple types of stories. For one, slow stories where the slowness needs to be emphasized. Stories that want to resemble life more closely (i.e. stories where time needs to be preserved to land; the Before trilogy and most slice-of-life movies are good examples). And movies where time needs to be used for dramatic effect. Prisoners uses time in this way incredibly well (along with most psychological thrillers).</p>
    <p class="general">A lot of the stories traditionally written in books are better suited to movies. Those slow detail-oriented stories should be put on film, not written out. A lot of why we don’t see this happen is culturally imposed time constraints on movies (2 hours and 30 minutes is typically the length limit) and genre conventions of books and movies.</p>
    <p class="general">I wanted to focus on insightful similarities and differences in this essay, so I didn’t discuss small things like how movies can have more varied vocal performances (in books, you typically get one description per line of dialogue whereas actors can change their vocalization throughout a line in film) and how edits in a film are synonymous to paragraph breaks in prose. But there are many more examples out there, which I encourage you to look for. Comparing literacy forms is often the best way to learn more about them.</p>
