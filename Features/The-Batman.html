    <p class="general">The separation between Bruce Wayne and Batman defines many of the caped crusader's outings. And while many previous television and film adaptations have upheld a distinct barrier between the character’s sides, The Batman blurs the distinction between Batman and Wayne to an almost invisible extreme. But what truly sets The Batman apart from others in the genre is how it approaches its villainous characters.</p>
    <p class="general">Playboy and vigilante are not separate parts of Batman’s character but molded together into a rich, determined, vengeful persona. When Batman needs answers about Bruce’s past to solve the film's central mystery, he, dressed as Bruce Wayne, goes to the Iceberg lounge and talks to Falcone. He’s acting on behalf of Batman, as Bruce Wayne. And when Batman needs to bring Falcone to justice but doesn’t want to stir up trouble at the Iceberg, he goes dressed as Bruce Wayne with a large splotch of black eyeliner (the black eyeliner being part of his Batman costume). While the surface value of this costume choice is to show the vengeance is more personal than usual (Falcone has had unsavory interactions with the Wayne family that Bruce wants to right by bringing Falcone to justice), the choice also illustrates how Wayne’s descent into Batman has crossed over into his personal life.</p>
    <p class="general">This merging of personalities becomes innovative when it interacts with the villains. At one point in the movie, Wayne has a sit-down talk with Penguin where Penguin is presented as a businessman first and villain second; during this conversation, there is no barrier between the characters (Penguin isn’t in a prison cell and Batman isn’t duct-taped to a chair). Only later does Batman treat Penguin as a suspect and keep him restrained as they talk. While other Batman movies have had well-designed villains and heroes, The Batman is the first to bring nuance to how heroes and villains interact without blurring the line between hero and villain. All the villains in The Batman are unambiguously villains, but Batman is able to talk with them without fighting first because he can act as Batman while dressed as Bruce Wayne.</p>
    <p class="general">Other DC movies like Harley Quinn have depicted aspects of a villain outside their villainous rein; however, they fail to capture it in full. In Birds of Prey, Black Mask is shown operating his club, but he still acts villainously evil while he’s at the club: he’s Black Mask without the mask as opposed to another side of his character. Most Marvel movies take a different approach and simply blur the line between hero and villain to create depth in a villain.</p>
    <p class="general">In some sense, The Batman writes Batman as a modern villain. We come to doubt if Batman’s vengeance motive justifies his violence (he is riddled with moral ambiguity); however, we never doubt he’s our hero. And the villains in The Batman are approached as modern heroes: they have personal lives beyond their public-facing villain personas (while with most modern heroes, it's a family used to contrast crime fighting, in The Batman, the villains have a legitimate business used to contrast the drugs and war behind the scenes). And it’s important to note that these villain-operated legitimate businesses in The Batman are explored and given depth in the film (not simply used as a plot device as they’re frequently used elsewhere).</p>
    <p class="general">The Batman's writing reversal of the heroes and villains without compromising the line between hero and villains is what sets it apart from the rest.</p>
