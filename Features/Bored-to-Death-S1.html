    <p class="general">Jonathan Ames is the executive producer of a show whose main character is named Jonathan Ames … COINCIDENCE, I think not. It's clear from the beginning that “Bored to Death” is Ames writing himself into a fantasy. The first question you may ask is: are his friends – played by Ted Danson and Zach Galifinakis – part of that fantasy? I would argue not; the fantasy is the detective work and, at least initially, Danson and Galifinakis aren’t involved in the detective work.</p>
    <p class="general">Being a fantasy, it’s not particularly obsessed with interesting cases, just your standard find a women variety (Ames even comments on this when he's asked to find a woman and he responds with something along the lines of “I get that a lot”). Commentary on the repetitive nature of the mystery drama is abundant. This genre commentary; however, doesn’t save the cases from being incredibly boring. Excuses like “that's what they do in detective stories” help to get the story moving and allow for a lot of plot to be skipped (i.e. “why are we here?” “because it's what they do in detective stories”). At first, the show does a mediocre job of changing up the formula; the first couple of episodes are the standard variety: Ames gets a case, Ames has a B-plot with Danson or Galifinakis, and Ames solves the case. However, after the first set of episodes, and especially towards the beginning of the second season, the writers do a great job of incorporating the personal world of Ames and the cases into the A-plot case. Episodes are moving more to focusing on the characters and how they interact with the case (the show avoids the cliche of characters learning and growing from the cases they solve as well as the cliche of a writer getting material from the cases). The cases are a backdrop for fun and character.</p>
    <p class="general">The show is best when the case is used for the backdrop; they keep the stories thematically consistent and work really really well for progressing the plot. Which is why the finale of season 1, “Take a Dive”, felt just bad (this is the episode where they fight GQ); it felt slow and didn’t feel like it was building up to anything even though it was clearly building up to the big fight.</p>
    <p class="general">Alright, enough on plot, now onto characters. Each is impeccable. They all have a reason to do what they do – and that reason isn’t just that they’re complete losers. They all have something to lose or gain and that's clear from the beginning (not something you see often in comedies). Each character feels so unique, both because of the fantastic acting, and the unique situations they’re in (I mean Galifinakis isn’t in a super unique situation, but his acting makes it unique). The B-plots are used so effectively to show how each wants an escape from their life and how detective work can do that for them. And the WEEEEEED is so effective again at showing how they want to escape and have some fun with a case.</p>
    <p class="general">What I want out of the second season: interesting cases, having personal conflicts interact with the cases (not the other way around because that's cliche), and continuously changing dynamics.</p>
