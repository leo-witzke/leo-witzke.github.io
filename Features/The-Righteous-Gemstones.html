    <p class="general">On paper, The Righteous Gemstones is a good show. And on paper, it was received as a good show. However, it lacks the cultural presence of other HBO shows such as Euphoria and more comparably Succession. Even though it has Danny Mcbride, John Goodman, and Adam DeVine to give the gemstone its starshine, The Righteous Gemstones fails to seep into discourse. Why?</p>
    <p class="general">Tying together The Righteous Gemstones is a tried and true trick to make any story feel cohesive – a violent parallel plot. McBride’s estranged son is trying to blackmail money out of McBride using a not-church-approved video of McBride; however, McBride doesn't know his son is the blackmailer. This violence puts the story’s tone in conflict; part of it wants to be satire on televangelist megachurches, and the other wants to be a formulaic drama with an action backing. The result is an uneven story that jumps between foci and eventually has to retreat back to its only major through-line – the violent parallel plot – to stay on track.</p>
    <p class="general">While the heterogeneous blend of tones is what stops the show from being great, it's also what keeps it good. The Righteous Gemstone is Danny McBrides’ take on today’s fad of overly serious dramas, and from this perspective, it's a partial success. It subverts the overly dramatic expectations of its premise with comedic characters; while the plot never makes a joke, the characters do. The show captures much of McBride’s humor (more on this later) and leaves room for all the other gemstones to shine. However, all these pros have their inherent cons.</p>
    <p class="general">Without the plot driving the comedy, you're only able to capture a portion of McBrides’ talent. Nearly all the humor on the show comes from character relationships; the strong exception being when Goodman’s character forces goons from a rival church to strip down and run home naked. Character relationships are necessary for all comedy, however, they shouldn’t be the only driving force. Without plot-based humor, the characters' personalities fail to mesh with the show's structure; McBride can’t have hilarious repercussions on the story because the story isn’t treated as an extension of the characters. In previous work, McBride’s comedy has come off as bombastic because it destroys the world around him and has no sympathy, but none of that aspect of his comedy comes through because his character is restrained from altering the story for comedic purposes.</p>
    <p class="general">The show hasn’t gone big because while it has all the right elements, it has difficulty combining them together. By no single metric is it a bad show; but when looked at holistically, it just isn’t great.</p>
