    <p class="general">Capturing the vibe of Rick and Morty’s interdimensional cable, a series of sketches about absurd television in other dimensions, is usually relegated to the futuristic science fiction backgrounds of Total Recall and Batman Beyond. So to say The Rehearsal, a documentary series, fits the mold is quite odd.</p>
    <p class="general">An ongoing bit on interdimensional cable is television shows with fringe premises having the power to pursue that premise over ethical lines. In “Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate,” Morty points out an odd-looking lady at a nearby coffee machine. Rick turns on the TV to a live broadcast of a lady standing on a lamppost; Morty recognizes it as the odd-looking lady. He looks back to the coffee machine and she has disappeared; now she’s on the TV asking herself how she got there. The show has the power, and supposed right, to kidnap random people, and everyone accepts that so they can be entertained.</p>
    <p class="general">Also in “Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate” is Eyehole Man: a spandex-clad alien who beats up anyone trying to eat his brand of cereal. No one is immune to Eyehole Man’s fists (in fact, Jerry, Morty’s dad, gets attacked by Eyehole Man in a post-credit scene), but everyone still finds it entertaining. Being on television gives interdimensional cables’ shows the authority to do what they want. To distill the recurring joke into three parts, it’s an unethical weird idea, power to enact, and threat it could happen to anyone.</p>
    <p class="general">In The Rehearsal, the weird idea is giving people the opportunity to rehearse a big moment of their life. Whether that's raising a child, confronting a brother, or telling a friend the truth. The Rehearsal allows its participants to practice the moment over and over with actors, replica sets, and Nathan Fielder’s guidance. The crossing of ethical lines comes when Fielder and his crew spin lies to push the rehearsal forward. Whether that's hiring actors to create fake relationships with participants (and not telling the participant it's an actor) or pretending to be investigating a gas leak to sneak into a participant’s house, The Rehearsal will do anything for the rehearsal.</p><p class="general">The power to enact is its budget – or rather its ability to demonstrate its budget. Fielder will comment on how expensive the show is and build sets to replicate real buildings. How much does it cost to replicate a building? Probably as much as it costs to build any set. But how much does it add to the show's production value when you build the replica in an all-black room so all your eyes can focus on is the bar replica set sitting in the middle of an empty warehouse? A lot more than it's worth.</p><p class="general">Fielder’s crew has the budget to pretend to be a team investigating a gas leak in order to get inside a participant's apartment and take a scan of the living room so a replica set can be created so Fielder can rehearse his first-time meeting with said participant. That’s a run-on sentence because, at its core, the entertainment of The Rehearsal is its ability to rabbit hole and use trains of offbeat logic to run an idea into the bizarre; its budget allows it to do that.</p><p class="general">Of course, it only got the budget it has because Nathan Fielder is attached to the project, but we’ll get into Fielder a bit.</p><p class="general">Could you be the target of a rehearsal? Yes, and you would have no idea.</p><p class="general">The Rehearsal manages to feel futuristic as a documentary show because it captures these ideas. But while interdimensional cable feels like an assortment of silly and reckless interludes, The Rehearsal holds onto a surprising amount of human drama centered around Fielder. And instead of going against the futuristic tone of the show, Fielder's presence elevates it.</p><p class="general">Fielder’s mystique may be the most futuristic thing about the show. He’s trusted by those around him when he shouldn’t be. He’s a puppet master in your face: throwing away the line between show and reality.</p><p class="general">Nathan For You (Fielder’s previous show) fits all the criteria for a futuristic show but lacks that futuristic vibe due to a few key differences in how Fielder presents himself.</p><p class="general">The pitch of Nathan For You was: here is something crazy, now will they go along with it? The pitch for The Rehearsal is much blander. The Rehearsal gives someone something they want, and the intrigue is what happens when they get what they want. In The Rehearsal, Fielder is presented as a good figure, as opposed to a mechanism for inciting comedy. Fielder masks all his desires behind a constant will to make the best rehearsal possible. The participants are guided into thinking they’re in control. All the while Fielder is pushing them to their limits behind the scenes.</p><p class="general">It’s also important to note we take on Fielder’s perspective for The Rehearsal. Whereas Nathan For You takes the participants' perspective to sell the craziness of Fielder’s ideas, The Rehearsal stays with Fielder – we’re guided through the episodes by Fielder’s voiceover. The show guides you to laugh at the participants, not Fielder.</p><p class="general">Fielder is the puppet master we’re meant to empathize with.</p><p class="general">It's safe to say Fielder only exists on the show. Futuristic because his life is only on the screen. It's utterly vapid outside the show.</p><p class="general">At time of writing, the personal life section of Fielder’s Wikipedia page is two sentences. These are those two sentences: “Fielder was married to a children's librarian from 2011 until their divorce in 2014. He is erroneously listed as female on his U.S. green card.” We don’t even know the name of the librarian.</p><p class="general">What are Fielder’s intentions? Why does he make the show? What is Fielder’s existence outside the show? Fielder does a good job at hiding these answers.</p><p class="general">Fielder's character is simply too tied to the screen to be transposed into reality. He’s a star you know and watch for, but may never want to meet because who knows what he’s up to.</p><p class="general">Fielder creates a utopia for each participant and, by the nature of the show, orchestrates its turn to dystopia. That's the plot of a lot of futuristic YA novels, but now the focus isn’t on a rebel in the system, but on the system manifested as a man.</p>
