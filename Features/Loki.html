      While the character arcs are forced in the very Disney fashion, Loki manages to twist a predictable plot to mild results.

    <p class="general">
      Disney has a few reliable messages these days: stay true to yourself, don't be evil, and coming together is cool. Marvel has done an OK job in the past of straying away from these themes - don't be evil is all over, but a lot of times that's mixed in with another context. Iron Man is about not being evil in terms of greed. Black Panther added a lot of moral ambiguity to that message. Civil War distorted what good and evil meant by pitting superheroes against each other. Nonetheless, with the exception of the Avengers movies, coming together was not a big part of the MCU's messaging as much as don't be evil was. Loki; however, is bringing that message to the forefront; however, it chooses to apply that message to a character(s) that almost exclusively work alone. So to deal with the theme of how people come together, it first has to deal with getting everyone on the same side. As a result, Loki’s character arc, and many other character arcs, feels forced to satisfy larger messaging – I called it that Mobius would turn sides well before he did. Once you become saturated with enough Disney, you know where the message of the story is going and can figure out character arcs from there. The character arcs feel especially forced when you consider some of the ways the show forces people to talk to each other; Loki upsetting Sylvia's master plan was just a way to get them to talk and come together. I don't really believe Loki could have upset her plan that easily, and Sylvia makes very limited efforts to stand in his way. In conclusion, Disney needs to find a new message because it's plaguing their shows; Loki will end with everyone coming together to mark my words (Edit: as predicted, this is what happened).

      On the topic of plot, I appreciate the shift of the enemy to being an institution rather than a singular person; it will probably turn out to be a single person in the end, but it's nice now while it's not (Edit: also what happened; it's pretty hard to write something in the MCU without an explicit villain so I’ll give them a pass here).

      The editing in Loki ever so slightly baffles me. The final fight scene of episode 4 starts with very quick cuts between multiple wide shots (and by multiple I mean like 6 or 7) and then cuts to the Time Keepers for longer than it held on any of the wide shots. It's unclear what the focus of the scene is; the fighting's editing is jumbled and the inclusion of the Time Keepers is just distracting. However, the shots of the Time Keepers are a nice visual addition; they have smoke spreading away from them when they’re shot in singles and this is one of the few MCU productions that uses visual effects outside of fight scenes to add atmosphere and world-building. Back to the point; the editing issues underscore a broader issue of poorly done fight scenes; the majority of MCU fight scenes add a little camera shake, have a couple fights to edit between, and cut frequently. These are not bad moves, but they're bland when it's all the MCU does. The fight at the end of episode 4 is an exception to this formulaic bad fight, but a bad exception.

      What ties Loki together is the plot twists that they're packing in. Ohh, and Owen Wilson because he feels more like a protagonist than Loki at this point  – what with him having the least forced character arc and all.
