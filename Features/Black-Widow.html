    <p class="general">Action movies have been in a dialogue rut for a while now. As the action genre becomes more streamlined and star-centric, naturally the writing is falling to the cutting room floor (or maybe the writer’s floor; somewhere along the line it's getting destroyed, who knows where). I want to focus on this dialogue problem in Black Widow, but I’m going to pull in another example to highlight a problem Black Widow’s dialogue doesn’t have.</p>
    <p class="general">It would be good to start by listing off some of the lines I take issue with. The following lines are from a scene a little under halfway into Black Widow when Scarlet Johansen and Florence Pugh’s characters (who play estranged sisters) meet.</p>
    <p class="general">Johansen: ‘Cause I don’t know if I can trust you</p>
    <p class="general">Pugh: Funny, I was going to say the same thing</p>
    <p class="general">Johansen: So, we gonna talk like grown-ups?</p>
    <p class="general">Pugh: Is that what we are</p>
    <p class="general">These lines put so much focus on retorting, that it takes away from the actual character relationships. Dialogue like this isn’t bad from time to time; however, it's becoming the focus of every dialogue that involves two enemies. If the dialogue was reframed around the characters instead of the tone of the story, you would probably end up with something along these lines:</p>
    <p class="general">Johansen: ‘Cause I don’t know if I can trust you</p>
    <p class="general">Pugh: We’re sisters aren’t we</p>
    <p class="general">Johansen: Can we talk like sisters?</p>
    <p class="general">Pugh: I don’t want to talk</p>
    <p class="general">This dialogue, I would argue, preserves the tone while reframing the dialogue to focus on the character’s relationships. There's more depth to the character relationships this way as it's not framed as enemy VS. enemy but sister VS. sister; of course, the audience knows it's a sister VS. sister relationship, but that doesn’t mean the dialogue shouldn’t reflect this as a point of interest. We also show signs of both of them wanting to come together in this exchange. Pugh’s second line hints that Johansen should trust Pugh, and Johansen reaching out and acknowledging their sisterhood bond shows she cares. In the original dialogue, you do get Johansen reaching out, but it feels more out of the sense of her own safety as she asks if they can talk like grown-ups implying she just wants to minimize the danger at play.</p>
    <p class="general">Additionally, this dialogue sheds the retorting aspect of the original. When Johansen asks a question, she actually gets a response (giving the conversation some meat to it). Johansen’s first line “‘Cause I don’t know if I can trust you” is her asking if she can trust Pugh – just not in question form – and we get Pugh’s indirect answer to that (more meat than the original exchange gives, but admittedly still not a ton of meat). Johansens’s second question does get an answer and that gives the exchange some desperately needed substance.</p>
    <p class="general">This dialogue is certainly not the worst I’ve seen – it's far from it in fact. In Red Notice promotional material recently, I’ve seen the following exchange between the Rock’s character and Ryan Reynolds’ character.</p>
    <p class="general">Rock: We’re not friends</p>
    <p class="general">Reynolds: We’re best friends</p>
    <p class="general">Now, I’m not going to carp on this dialogue. It's meant as humor and while I haven’t seen Red Notice, I highly doubt it's going for meaningful character development or character relationships. I just wanted to point out that the worst action dialogue I’ve seen takes this form. There’s a focus on semantics and changing the other’s words against them which almost always falls flat because it turns a possibly tense scene into a writing contest that's irrelevant to each character’s inner identity beyond good and evil. At least Red Notice’s dialogue has Ryan Reynolds doing his Ryan Reynolds thing; again, not insulting Red Notice’s dialogue. Haven’t seen the movie and the dialogue here isn’t meant to be a tense exchange (in fact it's meant to be the opposite), I just wanted to use it as a jumping-off point to explore some other bad dialogue.</p>
    <p class="general">There are ways to keep dialogue’s action tone while reframing it to mean something to the characters. Cut the retorting, focus on the interpersonal relationship within the dialogue, answer questions the characters ask, and follow other basic dialogue rules and you should be fine.</p>
