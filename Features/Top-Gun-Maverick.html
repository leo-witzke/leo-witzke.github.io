    <p class="general">While not directed by Christopher McQuarrie, I largely credit Top Gun: Maverick’s invigorating energy to him producing and writing the movie. Comparing Joseph Kosinski’s, Top Gun: Maverick’s actual director, previous movies (Oblivion, TRON: Legacy) to McQuarrie’s directing credits (Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Mission: Impossible - Fallout) reveals both worked with Tom Cruise before Top Gun: Maverick, but to different results. Oblivion played with science fiction, whereas the Mission Impossible franchise plays with Tom Cruise’s life – similar to Top Gun: Maverick. But there is more connecting McQuarrie’s past work to Top Gun: Maverick's tense thrills. While I couldn't articulate what it was, I could pinpoint it; I knew it had something to do with the structure of the climax. Then I played Modern Warfare.</p>
    <p class="general">Modern Warfare (2007) is structured like most other AAA games: it sets its sights shallow. What I mean by that is each level establishes a short-term goal and focuses on it. The big picture looms over each mission, but is never where the game focuses your attention. To keep the player invested and interested in playing more, each mission has to feel like it could be the last. To do so, short-term goals are explained as the solution to long-term goals. Then, the mission ends in a complication and you're presented with a new short-term goal to accomplish your long-term goal. This concept is also used to structure the gameplay within levels.</p>
    <p class="general">In a way, this is an extension of Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s (creators of South Park) writing philosophy. They say every scene should be linked by a “but” or “therefore” – i.e. keep your stories consequential. Video game structure extends this idea by adding “All we have to do is.” The structure of a video game level is then,</p>
    <p class="general">All we have to do is ___(short-term goal that accomplishes overarching/long-term goal)___, but ___(complication)___, therefore all we have to do is ___(complication leads to new short-term goal that accomplishes long-term goal)___</p>
    <p class="general">And so on …</p>
    <p class="general">The Safdie brothers (directors of Good Time and Uncut Gems) have done some great work imploring this structure, but most movies can’t create the same “it could end at any moment” feeling. For one, we’re conscious that most movies have an 80-120 minute runtime – the movie can’t end after 50 minutes. This is true of video games as well, but to a lesser extent since games last longer, have more varied durations, and it's easy to lose track of time over multiple play sessions. It's also incredibly exhausting to structure movies this way. Uncut Gems was great, but it’s hard to take that tension for so long. Not every movie is going for Safdie brothers' level of tension.</p>
    <p class="general">Take Top Gun: Maverick for example, it wants to keep the story tense, but also wants to revisit the past, play beach football, and sing songs at a bar. The movie isn’t going for wall-to-wall tension until the climax, at which point, it uses video game structure to create tension. The climax is a get-in-and-get-out style mission. Getting out is the long-term goal. The biggest complication comes when Tom Cruise and Miles Teller’s planes are shot down, so they decide to steal planes from the enemy’s base. All they have to do is fly out, but their planes are shot down, therefore all they have to do is steal a plane, but the plane is old, therefore all they have to do is get the plane running, but the runway is destroyed, therefore all they have to do is use a taxiway to takeoff, but enemy planes find them. You could continue this chain, but what's important to note is that with each short-term goal, you feel you’re making progress towards the end and are almost at the end. It's like racing to a moving finish line: you're continually almost there. Top Gun: Maverick is so tense because it uses video game structure to extend that “almost there” feeling throughout the climax.</p>
    <p class="general">Top Gun: Maverick’s structure diverges from video games in a couple of ways. For one, only Top Gun: Maverick’s climax (as opposed to the entire movie) is structured like a video game, and by doing so, Top Gun: Maverick avoids a common problem. After feeling like the end is near for so long, often video game climaxes don’t feel monumental and lose some of their meaning. Additionally, Top Gun: Maverick never introduces a complication that changes the long-term goals. The goal is always to get in, destroy the plant, and get out. By never changing the overarching goal, the audience can clearly identify when we’re at the end and feel that sense of climax. Top Gun: Maverick plays with our perception of how close we are to the end but never changes what the end is.</p>
    <p class="general">When I credit McQuarrie for Top Gun: Maverick’s success, it's because I see this same video game structure in all of his Mission Impossibles – and I can’t get enough of it. Top Gun: Mavericks' climax is a double down on McQuarrie's success with the Mission Impossible franchise. Now, I can’t wait to see what McQuarrie does with Mission Impossible 7 and 8.</p>
