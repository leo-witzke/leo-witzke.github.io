    <p class="general">A presentation I gave on Watchmen’s theme of ends justifying means. There’s a lot I left out, but still I covered a fair amount. Specifically, I wanted to extend my analysis beyond Ozymandias; however, in doing so I made some analytic assumptions my presentation overlooked. Assuming how characters are presented directly relates to how to their philosophy is presented isn’t an assumption you can make all the time; however, since whether or not ends justify means is such a central theme to every character in Watchmen, I believe it is justified in this context.</p><p class="general">Below is the presentation video and the slides with the speaker notes I gave the presentation with.</p>
