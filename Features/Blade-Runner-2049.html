  <p class="general">Implied world-building, as it sounds, is world-building not directly communicated, but implied to
    exist somewhere out there.</p>
  <p class="general">Most often, you see implied world-building in sequels when the world-building of the previous films
    is implied. The opening intertitle of Blade Runner 2049 has this implied world-building when it says “THOSE THAT
    HUNT THEM STILL GO BY THE NAME … BLADE RUNNER.” That “still” implies there is more to the story. </p>
  <p class="general">Implied world-building is usually a small thing. Every MCU movie, except some of the
    early movies, is loaded with implied world-building; however, the MCU uses implied world-building differently than
    Blade Runner 2049. In the MCU, movies are segmented; each movie is part of the larger picture, but each movie also
    exists outside the larger picture – for the most part. Blade Runner 2049 doesn’t feel like that. When we first meet
    Harrison Ford’s character, it feels like he’s in the middle of a character arc – we barely get an introduction. And
    by the end of the movie, we only feel like we’ve seen the second half of his character arc. It's implied Ford’s
    character is continuing an unfinished arc from Blade Runner.</p>
  <p class="general">Blade Runner 2049, and specifically Harrison Ford’s character, doesn’t exist without Blade Runner.
  </p>
  <p class="general">Now, I’ve never seen Blade Runner (I’m not much for Ridley Scott), but the implication that
    Harrison Ford’s character was building off Blade Runner in an incomplete sense (i.e. in the sense that his character
    arc wasn’t done in Blade Runner) made Blade Runner 2049, an already 3-hour movie, feel like the conclusion of a 6-hour 
    movie. It's quite an effective choice to build up the narrative scale of your story.</p>
  <p class="general">Blade Runner 2049 is full of implied world-building; like when Ryan Gosling jumps through a thick
    wall. Nowhere is it established that he can break through concrete and it never comes up again. It's just implied he
    was built that way. Implied world-building works best when it's small details that aren’t significant to the story;
    if they’re never used in a way significant to the story, it never feels like the writer is just using them to avoid
    some situation. I’ll put it this way, if you use small, never before mentioned, details to build climactic moments,
    they feel fake. The small detail that Ana de Armas’s character is contained on a flash-drive type device is set up
    extensively so that when the flash drive is broken, the audience feels the force of that action.</p>
  <p class="general">I want to clarify what I mean by implied world-building. A nice touch of world-building in Blade
    Runner 2049 is the various models of cars the characters drive; Harrison Ford’s got the oldest and most run-down;
    Ryan Gosling’s got an OK car; and the Wallace people (the “villains”) have the very best. Of course, these details
    “imply” something; namely that Harrison Ford’s an old character and Wallace’s people have a lot of money. What it
    implies is explicit. When I say implied world-building, I mean world-building that implies the world is rich and
    expansive without saying explicitly what that is or giving the audience enough information to figure out what it
    implies.</p>
  <p class="general">In conclusion, not watching the prequel to a movie can make the experience more enjoyable as it can
    imply a larger expanse of the world. People should really start marketing movies as sequels to movies that don’t
    exist; I think it's a nice illusion to imply a broad scope to a film.</p>
