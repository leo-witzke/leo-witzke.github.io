    <p class="general">Masculinity and vulnerability are usually presented in contrast to each other in portrayals of hyper-masculine ideals. Because of this, Fight Club’s positive depiction of vulnerability in the context of masculinity is overlooked, so let’s take a look at it.</p>
    <p class="general">The frame of Fight Club presented at the top of this analysis shows a shirtless Brad Pitt with a cigarette in his mouth, a beer in his hand, and a scar down his chest. The cigarette and beer are subtle symbols generally associated with masculinity, but the scar? And look how relaxed Brad Pitt is: his left hand dangling off an equally loose, but obscured, arm. There’s a great sense of power emanating off Pitt’s muscles, but that power is accompanied by a scar and a relaxed man – i.e. vulnerability. Masculinity and vulnerability are side by side.</p>
    <p class="general">Put it this way, fighting is both punching and taking the punches. Normally, when a man is injured, the response he’s taught is: “you should see the other guy.” But in Fight Club, there is no conception of winning and losing (there’s no other guy you point to saying “they got it worse than I did”); you go to fight club to fight – not to win or lose. Thus, fight club consists of getting beat and beating, and there's a great vulnerability in getting beat – a vulnerability inherent to the masculine ideal of fighting that Fight Club presents.</p>
    <p class="general">Take Brad Pitt’s confrontation with Lou as further evidence. Lou owns the space Pitt has been using for fight club and wants Pitt out. When Lou gets angry, he starts punching Pitt and Pitt laughs through it – telling everyone to back off and let Lou beat him. Pitt enjoys the beating and gets what he wants out of it (after Lou finishes with Pitt, Pitt jumps on top of him and makes Lou let them use the space). Being vulnerable to Lou is what let Pitt win.</p>
    <p class="general">Inherent to fighting is a vulnerability that Fight Club depicts as a positive (contrary to many hypermasculine depictions). Fight Club is often referred to as an examination of what can happen when masculine ideals are taken too far, but I would argue it's got a lot of positive things to say about masculinity that are overlooked.</p>
