    <p class="general">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the first MCU film to really feel like a comic book. One of comics’ most unique aspects is balancing self-contained stories and larger plotlines (at least for long-running comics that is). For the most part, MCU films are self-contained stories first, and a shared universe second. And while Vol. 3 is no different, its characters evoke a shared universe far more than Avengers or any other MCU film.</p><p class="general">In a shared universe, characters span many stories and thus, can be separated from their stories. Because Batman stories are prolific, when I describe Batman, I describe him as an orphan who gets buff, not as that guy who slammed Joker’s head into a table. However, the self-contained tendencies of MCU films restrict this form of characterization. In Spider-Man: Homecoming, Iron Man supports Spider-Man’s arc, but his character is static. And because he doesn’t change, his characterization in Homecoming is solely informed by his previous movies; his character becomes synonymous with his story. In Vol. 3, Kraglin plays a minor role, but he has an arc (he moves on from Yondu's death and learns to believe in himself). When characters change, you see a broader story in them – one that could be intertwined into a shared universe. The more characters that change, the more story possibilities an audience sees in the shared universe.</p><p class="general">Will these foreshadowed stories come to fruition? I don’t know. Whereas comics are loose with causality (they’ll make things up to solve a problem, then forget it), the MCU has been thoughtful and consistent; things are set up and happen with a purpose and for a reason. Iron Man’s suit has to break down at high altitudes so that in the climax, it can happen to the villain. But in Vol. 3, when the High Evolutionary reveals his true intentions, Rocket is suddenly able to make a key to his cell out of spare parts. Why? A: he’s a genius or B: it’s crucial for his character arc that he tries to escape; I see B as a stronger reason. Comics have a great freedom in being able to do whatever they want; it takes roughly equivalent effort to draw a park and a secret government satellite orbiting Mars. This freedom feels contrived when trying to force character development like accidentally sending the Orgocorp spacesuits out into space in Vol. 3 (which forced Quill and Gamora to confront each other). But when this freedom is motivated by character (as is the case with Rocket engineering a key), it’s an effective way to craft a character arc around a story.</p><p class="general">Vol.3 feels like a comic book because it writes characters like a comic book. The Guardians are a ragtag group of friends trying to save their friend, not heroes trying to save the world. They’re a speck in a larger universe, and after reading so many superhero comics, that's just how you perceive superheroes; Vol. 3 captures that feeling better than any previous MCU films.</p>
