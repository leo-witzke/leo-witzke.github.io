    <p class="general">There can be no succession on Succession; Succession is about passing the torch, and naturally, the act of passing the torch concludes when the torch is passed. The Roy children are in a perpetual state of conflict without promise of future resolution. In these stressful conditions, can Conner find love?</p>
    <p class="general">Sure, Logan puts very little stress on Conner, but Conner makes that up by fabricating his own worries like his presidency campaign. And make no mistake, the minute responsibilities Logan does sends down swell into Connor’s life. But before we get into Connor, to give a complete picture of my opinions on Conner’s entanglement with love, I have to explain the perspective I’m coming from. To do so, let me tell you how I see the other Roy family bonds. Kendall loves all the other Roys (even when he’s the family’s opposition, he does so with more dignity than he treats non-family rivals), Shiv loves as a second priority, Roman is forced to love due to his dependence on the family, and Logan loves his family, but his business side is too overwhelming for love to come through often. I see the Roys not as a disheartened family, but as a family whose love is distorted by business.</p>
    <p class="general">Conner, although he’s exempt from most business affairs, still has love take on irregular forms. Perhaps Conner was unable to distinguish between Logan’s business pretense and his family facade (the duality could be a little blurry to him), but at some point, and for one reason or another, love lost some meaning to Conner. When Connor proposes to Willa, all he’s looking for is a “yes”. When Willa says she needs time to think, Conner doesn’t interpret this as a warning sign: he waits and cherishes the “yes” when it comes. Willia’s “yes”, and by extension “love”, are the words Conner bases his love on; the act of loving means little to Conner. Connor’s love is almost, but not totally, reliant on semantics.</p>
    <p class="general">Why Connor’s love takes this shape can only be speculated. As mentioned earlier, it may have been hard for Connor to separate Logan’s business bustle from his private affections. He hears Logan say “I love you”, but when Logan’s actions contradict love’s conventions, he ignores them leading to a devotion to the words rather than the emotions attached.</p>
    <p class="general">Like most Succession characters, Conner’s love becomes interesting when it intersects with power. But unlike the other Roys, he’s not a part of the family business. Usually, it's the business that pushes Roys apart, but for Conner, not being a part of the business makes him irrelevant. Up to the end of season 3, Conner’s only interest in the company was for power: he wanted a job to boost his presidential resume – not for any further purpose. However, at the end of season 3, Conner’s irrelevancy to his father is put into words (i.e. in a form Conner understands).</p>
    <p class="general">When Kendall is referred to as the eldest son, Conner defends himself as the eldest (Conner being the eldest in age, Kendall is only the eldest child in the context of potential successors to the company). The implication of referring to Kendall as the eldest son is that Conner isn’t part of the family because he isn’t part of the business. This has been true in some sense for the entire series, but having his siblings say it is what made it true for Conner. After a failed presidential run, I think Conner will try to join the company not for power but for love (assuming Season 3’s ending was a bluff). Unable to deny the words spat in his face, Conner won’t stop vying for his father's love until he hears the words: “I love you, son” (even if they have to be forced out of Logan’s mouth).</p>
    <p class="general">On a show about the insignificance of words and discovering people's true motives, Conner is unique in his ability to only communicate through words. Love, to Conner, is just a word; saying “love” is love.</p>
