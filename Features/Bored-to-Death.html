    <p class="general">I’m not quite sure what to call this review. It's hard to capture every aspect of my strong feelings for the show’s second and third seasons with a quick snark. Instead, I’ll tell you directly what I think. Bored to Death season 2 is some of the best comedy writing out there (and the acting is up there as well); Bored to Death season 3 has some of the worst comedic writing out there and goes in way too many weird directions.</p>
    <p class="general">Season 3, and the show as a whole, concludes with Jonathan’s sperm bank dad coming to rescue him from perilous danger; however, Jonathan’s friends had saved him just before Jonathan’s sperm bank dad arrived. That's the end of the show right there. There is no falling action to wrap up the dad's story, he just arrives to save his son and the show ends. From this perspective it's played very comedically; it’s funny that Jonathan’s dad actually came back to save him – we were led to believe he wouldn’t – but couldn’t. This isn’t a terrible joke, but it doesn’t fit in the show. Sure, what's underlying the joke is the importance of friends – as Jonathan’s friends were the ones to save him – and this is one of the most stressed themes of the show, but the overarching plot of season 3 was trying to find Jonathan’s dad so ending on a note that leaves Jonathan’s dad’s character arc incomplete feels super wrong. Not objectively wrong, but wrong within the tone of the show. The best cases of seasons 2 & 3 are the ones that empathize with the case subjects; it’s against the tone of the show to act indifferent to a case subject, and nonetheless one as important as Jonathan’s dad. What disappoints me so much about Season 3 is how close it was to being good. If the show had given better treatment to the case, and character, it would have been as good, but certainly not better than season 2.</p>
    <p class="general">That's an overview of why Season 3 disappoints me to such an extent. I’ve made a lot of comparisons to Season 2 in my overview, so I best now explain why Season 2 works so well.</p>
    <p class="general">When I wrote my review of Bored to Death Season 1, I said “what I want out of the second season: interesting cases, having personal conflicts interact with the cases (not the other way around because that is cliche), and continuously changing dynamics”. I got all of that and more out of Season 2. Not only did the personal conflicts interact with the cases, but the cases interacted with personal conflicts and it was incredible, I mean truly magnificent writing. Cases revolving around personal conflicts, cases leaving lasting impressions on characters, characters being put in conflicts that revolve around choosing between the case and personal matters; all of it impressively written. Cases got more interesting. The dynamics were changing all over the place; the dynamic between Zach Galifinakis and his wife carried the show through the first half and then the dynamic between Ted Danson and the magazine carried the show through the second half.</p>
    <p class="general">What I wanted from Season 3 was essentially a more refined Season 2; there were places here and there that cases and personal conflicts could be more intertwined and …. that's about it. Everything else was perfect. I also would have been pleased to see Season 3 taken in a different direction; I like when shows surprise me. Given that the surprise is welcome. The surprise of Season 3 was not welcome.</p>
    <p class="general">What went wrong with Season 3:</p>
    <p class="general">* Characters' season arcs weren’t given time: instead of slowly building arcs as Season 2 did, arcs were crammed into episodes and weren't developed when they weren’t the center of attention.</p>
    <p class="general">* Ted Danson’s character arc is forced: Danson comes around to liking his daughter's fiance after the fiance says he has money (Danson’s character arc needed to wrap up and the writers decided to wrap it up after Danson and his daughter’s fiance discussed money: unintentionally imply Danson only likes his daughter’s fiance for the money which doesn’t fit with Danson’s character at all)</p>
    <p class="general">* Zach Galifianakis and Jason Schwartzman’s character arcs are odd. Zach Galifianakis starts dating an old lady and the show consistently makes mention of her age to the point that it presents the relationship as weird which contradicts Danson’s character arc of not judging people in relationships by age. Jason Schwartzman “accidentally” started dating his sister by blood – this arc is never wrapped up which makes the conclusion at the end of Season 3 all the more confusing.</p>
    <p class="general">* Cases lose their importance: the balance between character and case leans heavily towards character which removes a lot of the drive of the show (the cases were meant to push the show forward and provide some action to spice it up, and without time being dedicated to the cases, they lose their fun).</p>
    <p class="general">* Aim of Season 3 is unnecessary and distracting. The show is about being bored, so an overarching series plot isn’t necessary, and because they shove a lot of the overarching plot into the last couple of episodes, its existence in the initial episodes is distracting and interrupts the flow of many scenes.</p>
    <p class="general">All these critiques don’t leave much more at the core of the show. You have good acting and nothing remarkable in terms of directing, cinematography, or editing. Compared to Season 2, which doesn’t have any of these problems, it’s disappointing this is how the series had to end, especially when it could have been done so much better with a couple of tweaks.</p>
    <p class="general">If Jonathan’s plot to find his dad was paced better (possibly by having cases reveal information about Jonathan’s dad), the cases were more involved (make Jonathan – and Ray and George – sacrifice for the client), and Galifianakis and Danson’s were given better character arcs for the season, it could have been great – not perfect, but great.</p>
    <p class="general">Season 2: 4.5/5</p>
    <p class="general">Season 3: 2/5</p>
    <p class="general">Overall:</p>
